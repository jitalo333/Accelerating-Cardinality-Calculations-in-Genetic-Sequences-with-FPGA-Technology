# Accelerating-Cardinality-Calculations-in-Genetic-Sequences-with-FPGA-Technology

Calculating cardinality on an FPGA is crucial due to its capability to process large volumes of data in parallel with high efficiency. This is particularly important in bioinformatics applications, which often involve analyzing massive genetic sequences. FPGAs allow the implementation of hardware-optimized algorithms, significantly reducing computation time compared to CPU or GPU-based solutions. This advantage is especially pronounced for tasks requiring repetitive and computationally intensive operations, such as counting unique subsequences. As a result, FPGAs deliver faster processing, lower energy consumption, and enhanced adaptability to customized workflows, making them ideal for large-scale genetic analysis.
